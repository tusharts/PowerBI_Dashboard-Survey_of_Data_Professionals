This project showcases the skills I have learned in creating visualizations and dashboards using Power BI. It demonstrates my ability to:

- **Import and clean data:** I can effectively import data from various sources and clean it to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Transform data:** I can transform data using Power BI's built-in features to prepare it for analysis and visualization.
- **Create visualizations:** I can create a variety of visualizations, including cards, clustered column charts, and tree maps, to effectively communicate insights from the data.
- **Customize dashboards:** I can customize the theme and layout of dashboards to enhance their visual appeal and user experience.

## Data

This project utilizes a sample survey dataset of data professionals.

## Visualizations

The included Power BI dashboard (`survey_data.pbix`) demonstrates my skills in creating various visualizations, including:

- **Cards:** Key statistics and metrics are displayed for quick reference.
- **Clustered Column Charts:** These charts compare different categories of data across various dimensions.
- **Tree Maps:** This visualization provides a hierarchical view of the data, allowing for insights into relationships between different categories.

## Further Exploration

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration of Power BI's capabilities. I am eager to dive deeper into more advanced features and techniques to create even more comprehensive and insightful dashboards.
